# Chrome OS for web dev
This setup script for installing Ubuntu core on Crouton for web dev using an x86 Chrome OS device.  It is 
compatible with C9.io so dev environments can be replicated locally on x86 and remotely on ARM or resource
constrained Chrome OS devices.

Pull requests are welcome to improve the bash script quality or fix issues that experienced linux users may
be able to solve very easily.

*This script is public domain and may be used or modified in any way.*

## Starting servers
### Cloud9 http://127.0.0.1:8080 a browser based IDE 
Note: this is pre-installed on c9.io and port 8080 also maps to port 80.

    $ cd ~/c9
    $ sudo node server.js -w ~/projectfolder --listen 0.0.0.0 --port=8080

### git-webui http://127.0.0.1:8081 a browser UI for git
  
    $ cd my_project && git webui -p 8081 

### pgweb http://127.0.0.1:8082 a browser based RDBMS for Postgresql 
    
    $ sudo $GOPATH/bin/pgweb --bind=0.0.0.0 --listen=8082

### Deluge http://127.0.0.1:8083 a torrent server with web interface
Note: this does not get installed on c9.io

    $ sudo /usr/bin/deluge-web --no-ssl -p 8083
    
### Emby Media Server http://127.0.0.1:8096/
Note: Port is fixed and can only be changed on the running server web site
and this does not get installed on c9.io

    $ sudo /usr/bin/emby-server start
    
### Dropbox
First run it will generate a URL to link your computer
  
    $ ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd
    
Note:  Plex are the kind of company whose ethics permit them to go quite far to hide skip registration buttons but you don't actually need these untrustworthy people to monitor your library and usage to run software locally.  You will have to search for the 'skip registration' button during setup and opt out of the analytics etc if you don't have privacy / ad blocking extensions already.
